# MongoDB Query Returns Null Despite Existing Documents

This repository demonstrates a common issue where a MongoDB query returns `null` even though documents matching the query criteria exist in the collection.  The issue often stems from unexpected behavior in query operators or subtle differences in data types between the query and the collection's documents.

The example code showcases a potential problem and how to debug and resolve it.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains code that performs a MongoDB query using a regular expression for case-insensitive search. However, due to an oversight, the case-insensitive flag is either not correctly set or other filtering conditions prevent the document from matching.  This leads to the query returning null even if documents potentially match.
